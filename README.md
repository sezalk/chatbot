# Chatbot Project

This project is a simple web-based chatbot interface designed to interact with users through a chat-like interface. Users can input messages, and the chatbot responds with appropriate replies.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the chatbot interface.
- `style.css`: Defines the styling for the chatbot interface.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code responsible for handling user input, sending requests to an AI model (OpenAI's GPT-4), and displaying responses.

## Usage

To use the chatbot interface, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can interact with the chatbot by typing messages into the input field and pressing "Send" or hitting Enter.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- **Google Fonts**: Two fonts are imported from Google Fonts to style the interface (`Poppins` for general text and `Material Symbols` for icons).
- **OpenAI API**: To interact with the chatbot, you need an API key from OpenAI. Replace `"paste your api key here"` in `script.js` with your actual API key.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The chatbot interface is designed to work on various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Styling**: The interface includes dynamic styling effects for toggling the chatbot and adjusting the input field's height based on content.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Users can see real-time responses from the chatbot as they type messages.
- **Error Handling**: Error messages are displayed if there are any issues with the chatbot's response or API connectivity.

## Additional Notes

- For optimal performance and functionality, ensure that you have a stable internet connection, and your OpenAI API key is valid and properly configured.
- This project serves as a basic example of integrating a chatbot interface with an AI model. You can extend it further by customizing the UI, adding more features, or integrating with different AI services.
